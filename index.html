     <div class="col"><p class="education text-success">Ah, the legend of Prof Catius Catsen, the purr-fect astrophysicist! Well, before he became the feline Einstein we know today, Catius had a peculiar yet intriguing educational journey. He spent his elementary years at Whiskers Elementary School in Catville, where he first discovered his fascination with the mysteries of the cosmos, often gazing at the stars during recess.

        For high school, he attended Paws Academy, a renowned institution for ambitious cats in New York. It was there that he developed a reputation for his sarcastic wit and knack for seeing the lighter side of gravity. His passion for astrophysics blossomed, leading him to pursue his undergraduate studies at Meowington University in California. He aced his courses, earning a Bachelor's degree in Physics with a specialization in Stellar Dynamics, while also initiating the first-ever 'Cats in Space' club.
        
        His insatiable curiosity drove him to continue his academic journey, and he went on to pursue his postgraduate studies at Whiskerly Institute of Technology in Massachusetts. There, he delved deeper into theoretical astrophysics, completing his Ph.D. in Quantum Meowchanics, where he made groundbreaking discoveries in the field.
        
        After a series of whisker-twitching adventures in research and academia, Prof Catius Catsen found his way back to California, landing a prestigious position at UC Berkeley's astrophysics department. His lectures are as mind-bending as a wormhole and as entertaining as a cat chasing a laser pointer. His unique blend of humor and genius continues to inspire budding astrophysicists to reach for the stars while keeping their feet on the ground.</p></div>
